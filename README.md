# SimpleToDo-React App

## About 💁

I have started this project with the purpose of learning how to structure a Web App of a base-level complexity integrating the Redux logic.

At the time of the creation of the application, I have no experience with either Redux, or with a ReactJS, or with other technologies, only the experience of HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS ES6+

## Application Design

## Diagrams

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
Alice ->> Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
Bob-->>John: How about you John?
Bob--x Alice: I am good thanks!
Bob-x John: I am good thanks!
Note right of John: Bob thinks a long<br/>long time, so long<br/>that the text does<br/>not fit on a row.

Bob-->Alice: Checking with John...
Alice->John: Yes... John, how are you?
```

Need to edit a flow chart:

```mermaid
graph LR
A((isAuthored?)) -- true --> B(Log-in)
A -- false --> C(Sing-in)
B --> D{HomePage}
C --> B(Log-in)
```
